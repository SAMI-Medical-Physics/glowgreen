## [0.0.2] - 2022-02-04

### Added
- Added a contact pattern that combines 'Sleeping with spouse or partner' with 'Close contact with adult friends and family'.
Specifically, contact elements from 'Close contact with adult friends and family' were used to fill in blank elements in 'Sleeping with spouse or partner'.
Added restrictions that use this pattern for members of the public and informed persons supporting the patient:
  - 'Sleeping with person and prolonged daytime close contact (>15min)'
  - 'Sleeping with informed supporter and prolonged daytime close contact (>15min)'

### Changed
- For contact patterns involving sleeping, distance changed from 10 cm to 30 cm while sleeping.
- Removed separate restriction for sleeping with pregnant or child.
- Changes to restriction names. Now use "Prolonged close contact (>15min)" and "informed supporter".
